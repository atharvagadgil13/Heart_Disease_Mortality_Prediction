# Heart_Disease_Mortality_Prediction
Predicting heart disease using ML models with data visualization and evaluation.
Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning

This project predicts the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning algorithms. It involves preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation using a structured dataset of clinical features.

Dataset
The dataset contains medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate, and more. The target column indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

Key Features
Data loading and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations
Correlation analysis using a heatmap
Machine learning model training (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics
Manual testing with new patient input data

Tech Stack
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
